# Personal Messenger Bot

Bot I use for messenger group chats


# Todo

Things that I plan to work on

- [] database
- [] allow the command framework to load commands from path
- [] pyproject.toml for bot repo
- [] tests
- [] allow different files for config logging


For Toram side of things

- [] maybe auto statting calculator?
- [] a search feature for infos about weapons, xtals, etc.
- [] a calculator command that has prebuilt functions that calculate for some complicated stuffs (still thinking if its useful enough to add)
